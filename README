lab4c_tcp.c:
This program expands from my lab4b, which runs upon an Intel edison board and
reads the temperature at certain intervals from a temperature sensor attached
to the edison board. lab4c_tcp, however, reads also connects to a tcp server,
whose port number and host name are given as arguments. The --log argument
also allows the user to choose if he or she wants to log the input. This
program also takes a 9-digit ID through the --id argument, which it sends to
the server. The server then sends input to the program, which change how the
program logs the temperature. It outputs the temperature to the server instead
of to stdout.

lab4c_tls.c:
This program is similar in function to lab4c_tcp.c except it does not take any
arguments. Instead of connecting through TCP with a server of choice, the user
is automatically connected to the provided TLS port (port 19000, hostname is
lever.cs.ucla.edu). It also accepts input from the server and prints the
output to that server.

Makefile:
default: compiles lab4c_tcp.c and lab4c_tls.c into executables lab4c_tcp and
lab4c_tls respectively.
clean: removes files generated by the Makefile
dist: compresses the files included in the README into a gzipped tarball

README:
Describes the files included in the deliverable tarball
